This is my first project to create data store in local desktop.

An Azure Data Factory account
A data factory that contains a pipeline with one copy activity
An Azure Blob Storage account with moviesDB2.csv uploaded into an input folder as a source
A linked service to connect the data factory to Blob Storage
